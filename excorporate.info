Excorporate Manual
******************

Excorporate provides Exchange Web Services (EWS) support for Emacs.

   If the Exchange server you access is configured to provide EWS
support, then there's an 86% chance that Excorporate will enable you to
retrieve your calendar entries from the comfort of Emacs.

   The 14% failure rate is because authenticating against an Exchange
server can be challenging.

   Accessing an Exchange server through an HTTPS proxy is possible now
that <https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=10> and
<https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=35969> are fixed.

   Kerberos/GSSAPI authentication needs more experimentation.

   Reports of success or failure of different connection types are
welcome, as are patches to enable more of these access scenarios.  See
*note Reporting Bugs::.

1 Installation
**************

Excorporate works on Emacs versions >= 24.1.

Install 'excorporate' from the GNU ELPA repository:

   'M-x package-install RET excorporate'

2 Configuration
***************

Ideally you won't need to configure Excorporate beyond providing your
account email address.  On friendly Exchange setups, Excorporate can
discover the EWS URL automatically.

Run:

   'M-x excorporate'

which will prompt you for the Exchange account configuration.  Follow
the prompts and if all goes well, you'll see a message in the minibuffer
or in *Messages* saying that the connection is ready.  Using the
prompts, you can first try with autodiscovery.  If autodiscovery runs
out of URLs to try, re-run 'excorporate', saying 'n' to the
autodiscovery attempt, at which point you will be asked for the EWS URL.

To save a working configuration, customize 'excorporate-configuration':

   'M-x customize-variable RET excorporate-configuration'

After saving the configuration, try 'M-x excorporate' again.

If neither autodiscovery nor specifying the EWS URL work, *note
Troubleshooting::.

3 Usage
*******

Excorporate can put entries it retrieves into the Emacs Diary, and use
'appt' to remind you a few minutes before a meeting starts.  To enable
this support, do:

   'M-x excorporate-diary-enable'

Open the calendar with:

   'M-x calendar'

move the cursor to the date you want to see meetings for, and press 'd'.
Some time later, asynchronously, a window will pop up containing events
retrieved from the Exchange server in addition to locally-entered diary
events.  The events are all sorted by time.

   Excorporate also binds 'e' in '*Calendar*' buffers to
'excorporate-calendar-show-day-function' to allow a different view of
retrieved events.  By default, 'excorporate-calendar-show-day-function'
is set to 'exco-org-show-day' which displays meetings in a temporary
read-only Org Mode buffer named '*Excorporate*'.

   If you prefer, you can install the 'calfw' package, and set
'excorporate-calendar-show-day-function' to 'exco-calfw-show-day'.

   After you've retrieved today's meetings, 'appt' will warn you several
minutes before your next meeting starts by popping up a window with the
meeting details.

   If you leave Emacs running overnight, at 12:01 AM 'appt' (via
Excorporate) will retrieve your meetings and display your diary so that
you see the day's events first thing in the morning.

4 Troubleshooting
*****************

First, you'll want to double-check that the Exchange server you're
trying to access provides EWS support.  If it doesn't, Excorporate can't
do anything for you.  Before asking your Exchange administrator, check
intranet wikis and so forth; other users of non-standard clients may
have already found the EWS URL. This is called the "EWS endpoint".  It
can be as simple as, e.g.:

   'https://mail.gnu.org/ews/exchange.asmx'

First you need to make sure you can access the endpoint.

For Exchange Web Services (EWS) which Excorporate uses, you'll have to
determine the EWS endpoint for your Exchange account, call it 'ews-url'.
It is usually something like:

   https://<mail host name>/ews/exchange.asmx

Excorporate calculates the WSDL URL, call it 'wsdl-url', by replacing
the endpoint's last path element with "Services.wsdl":

   https://<mail host name>/ews/Services.wsdl

Before even attempting Excorporate, you have to make these succeed:

     (with-current-buffer
      (url-retrieve-synchronously ews-url)
      (buffer-string))

When this works, you'll see web page text in *Messages*, containing a
message about having created a service.

     (with-current-buffer
      (url-retrieve-synchronously wsdl-url)
      (buffer-string))

When this works, it will show a bunch of WSDL (XML) in *Messages*.

Debug the above URL retrievals with 'M-:' in an 'emacs -Q' run:

     (progn
       (setq url-debug 1)
       (url-retrieve-synchronously URL-STRING)
       (dolist (p (seq-filter
                   (lambda (b) (string-match " *http*" (buffer-name b)))
                   (buffer-list)))
         (message "HTTP result buffer: \"%s\"\n%s"
                  (buffer-name p)
                  (with-current-buffer p (buffer-string))))
       "check *Messages*")

Beware that HTTP responses can be out-of-order, and that if you set
'url-debug' to a number or 't', Emacs may hang for a while if it
attempts to print a very large data structure.

Once you're sure the above steps are working, try 'M-x excorporate'.

The buffer '*fsm-debug*' shows 'excorporate' state transitions and
should provide details of where things went wrong.

Also check '*Messages*' for anything obvious.

If you suspect something wrong with accessing the EWS URL, try setting
'url-debug' to t and retry 'M-x excorporate', then check the
'*URL-DEBUG*' buffer for output.

If you suspect NTLM authentication is failing, as a long shot, you might
try setting 'ntlm-compatibility-level' to 0 and retrying 'M-x
excorporate'.

Excorporate's dependencies implement the tricky elements of asynchronous
Exchange access: a state machine ('fsm'), TLS negotiation ('gnutls'),
NTLM authentication ('ntlm' and 'url-http-ntlm') and SOAP communication
('soap-client').
