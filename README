** Change default behaviour of decline, accept and tenatitvely-accept functions

Always prompt for a response message in
exco-org-decline-meeting-request, exco-org-accept-meeting-request, and
exco-org-tentatively-accept-meeting-request, unless a prefix argument
is specified.

** Allow force-deleting calendar items

Take a prefix argument to exco-org-delete-appointment to force-delete
the calendar item at point in the *Excorporate* Org buffer.

Quick Start
-----------

To create a connection to a web service:

M-x excorporate

Excorporate will prompt for an email address that it will use to
automatically discover settings.  Then it will prompt you for your
credentials two or three times depending on the server configuration.

You should see a message indicating that the connection is ready
either in the minibuffer or in the *Messages* buffer.

Finally, run M-x calendar, and press 'e' to show today's meetings.

If autodiscovery fails, customize `excorporate-configuration' to skip
autodiscovery.

For further information including connection troubleshooting, see the
Excorporate Info node at C-h i d m Excorporate.
